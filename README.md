# Machine Learning

A course offering by Andrew Ng in Coursera. 

This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, data mining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics covered in this course are: 

(i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks).

(ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning).

(iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI).

The course covers numerous case studies and applications, including building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.
